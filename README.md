# Unity-Projects
My own Unity projects to demonstrate my C# abilites. The game Ballz is my own creation, and used no tutorials. 3D Testing was an introduction to Unity, and Roguelike used some tutorials as another introduction to the 2D side of unity, but most files were my own creation/had no other tutorial or outside help.
